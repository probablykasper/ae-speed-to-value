# AE Speed to Value
Creates accumulating keyframes from a property in After Effects. If you have a property for the speed of a video, this can be used to turn that into the desired time remapping.

## Use cases
- Generate an accumulated Sound Keys output while keeping whatever falloff option you like.
- Turn your Twixtor Pro "Speed %" property into "Frame Num" to improve render times.

## Usage

1. Select the property you want to use as the speed
2. Run the script
3. A new effect called "Accumulated Value" will be created with the value
